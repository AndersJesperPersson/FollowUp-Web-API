# Follow Up
The final project in my .net studies. I've chosen to develop a software application that aims to assist social workers in their follow-ups against customer. A web app where you can create templates for a survey. Further on the user can choose a date when the surveys is supposed to go out to customer. The software will also collect the answers and compile the result, that till be presented in a clean and nice UI.

The project is a learning project and due to that the refactoring of code havenÂ´t been prioritized. Further on, there are some lack of styling in the project beacause I was running out of time. This project is covers the Web API of a full-stack project that are hosted at azure --> https://avonova-follow-up.azurewebsites.net/
Please see FollowUpSurveyUI repo that are made in React and using TypeScript.
